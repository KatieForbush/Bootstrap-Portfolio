                I am a 32 year old starting over. I was in customer service for the majority of my career with a focus
                on collections. So putting the customer first has always been my priority. Leading and training my girls
                in my office has always been a very enjoyable thing for me. I am patient, kind and love to have a good
                time as long as my work is also getting done. I originally took this course as a way to improve my
                skills to get a better job. I didn’t however realize that it would also improve me in a vast way.
                Meeting and working with so many different people from all walks of life has been overwhelming in a good
                way. I had forgotten one of my biggest passions in life and that is people. I am a team player 100%.
                Learning to code has been amazing and fun and I can’t wait to join a team that I can both work with and
                create something special with. <br>
                <br>


                People say the customer is always right, right? I can attest after over 15 years in customer service
                this statement is a double edged sword. However, I have enjoyed throughout those years leading a team
                through motivation and training! I am patient, goal oriented, organized and driven, which is what has
                lead me to this change in life and career! When looking for a change I realized I needed to be outside
                my comfort zone in order to grow both personally and professionally. Over the past few weeks while being
                out of my element, I have been reminded of one thing and that is customer service is the base to any
                career and from there you can grow within any path that you choose!
